# Introduction 
* I will explore __Sean Lahman__'s database on baseball teams to get some insights about __Team's spendings__ and __Winning rate__ and their relation...etc, Exploring basic Data Science techniques like __(Data Wrangling - Exploratory Data Analysis - Data Transformations).__<br> 

## A Bit of Background 
* __In Major League Baseball,__ A game is usually composed of __nine innings,__ an __inning__ in baseball is the __basic unit of play__, consisting of __2 halves or frames:__ the "top" (first half) and the "bottom" (second half). In each half, one team bats until three outs are made, with the other team playing defense.<br> 
* The team with the __greater number of runs__ at the end of the game __wins__. If scores are __tied__ at the end of nine innings, __extra innings__ are usually played.<br> 
* Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning. <br>
* In principle, better players are __more expensive__, so teams that want good players need to __spend more money.__ Teams that spend the most, frequently win the most; but this is __not always__ the case as we will see.
