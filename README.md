# Introduction 
* In this project, I will apply basic Data Science concepts like __(Data Wrangling - Exploratory Data Analysis - Data Transformations)__ to a Database on Baseball Teams, players and seasons created by __Sean Lahman.__ <br> 

## A Bit of Background 
* Iâ€™ll be working on data about teams in __Major League Baseball.__ Teams win games by scoring more runs than their adversary. In principle, better players are __more Expensive__, so teams that want good players need to __spend more money.__ Teams that spend the most, frequently win the most. 

### For More Information, __Check__ :
* [Wikipidea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball). <br>
* [The Moneyball Book](https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-The-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818) <br>
* [The Moneyball Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/) <br>

### Question 
__How Can A Team That Can't Spend So Much Win?__ 

### Database
* [lahman2014](https://github.com/jknecht/baseball-archive-sqlite/raw/master/lahman2014.sqlite) <br>
* We will be using __Salaries__ and __Teams__ tables of the database throughout the project.
