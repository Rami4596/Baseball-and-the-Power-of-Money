# Introduction 
* In this project, we will apply basic Data Science concepts like __(Data Wrangling - Exploratory Data Analysis - Data Transformations)__ to a Database on Baseball Teams, players and seasons created by __Sean Lahman.__ <br> 

## A Bit of Background 
* Weâ€™ll be looking at data about teams in __Major League Baseball.__ Teams win games by scoring more runs than their adversary. In principle, better players are __costlier__, so teams that want good players need to __spend more money.__ Teams that spend the most, frequently win the most. So, the question is, __How can a Team that can't spend so much win?__
