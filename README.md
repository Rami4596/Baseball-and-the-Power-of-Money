# Introduction 
In this project, we will apply basic data science concepts like __(Data Wrangling - Exploratory Data Analysis - Data Transformation ..)__
to a database on __Baseball__ Teams, players and seasons created by __Sean Lahman.__

## A Bit of Background 
We’ll be looking at data about teams in Major League Baseball. Major League Baseball is a professional baseball league, where teams pay players to play baseball. The goal of each team is to win as many games out of a 162 game season as possible. Teams win games by scoring more runs than their adversary. In principle, better players are costlier, so teams that want good players need to spend more money. Teams that spend the most, frequently win the most. So, the question is, __How can a team that can’t spend so much win?__ The basic idea that Oakland (and other teams) used is to redefine what makes a player good. I.e., figure out what player characteristics translated into wins. Once they realized that teams were not really pricing players using these characteristics, they could exploit this to pay for undervalued players, players that were good according to their metrics, but were not recognized as such by other teams, and therefore not as expensive.
