# Introduction 
* I'll be working on __Sean Lahman__'s database about baseball teams to get some insights about the data (Ex: Team's __spendings__ and __winning rate__ and their relation...etc). Exploring basic Data Science techniques like __(Data Wrangling - Exploratory Data Analysis - Data Transformations).__<br> 

## A Bit of Background 
* __In Major League Baseball,__ A game is usually composed of 9 innings, an __inning__ in baseball is the __basic unit of play__, consisting of 2 halves or frames: the __"top"__ (first half) and the __"bottom"__ (second half). In each half, one team bats until three outs are made, with the other team playing defense.<br> 
* The team with the __greater number of runs__ at the end of the game __wins__. If scores are __tied__ at the end of nine innings, __extra innings__ are usually played.<br> 
* Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning. <br>
* In principle, better players are __more expensive__, so teams that want good players need to __spend more money.__ Teams that spend the most, frequently win the most; but this is __not always__ the case as we will see. 

### For More Information, __Check__ :

* [The Moneyball Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/) <br>

### Question 
```diff
- __Can a team that does not spend much money achieve a good winning rate?__
```

### Database
* [lahman2014](https://github.com/jknecht/baseball-archive-sqlite/raw/master/lahman2014.sqlite) <br>
* I will be using __Salaries__ and __Teams__ tables of the database throughout the project.
