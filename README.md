# Introduction 
In this project, we will apply basic Data Science concepts like ( Data Wrangling - Exploratory Data Analysis __(EDA)__ - Data Transformations ) to a Database on __Baseball__ Teams, players and seasons created by __Sean Lahman.__ <br> 

### Database
__Available here :__ [lahman2014](https://github.com/jknecht/baseball-archive-sqlite/raw/master/lahman2014.sqlite) <br>
We will be using __Salaries__ and __Teams__ tables of the database.

## A Bit of Background 
We’ll be looking at data about teams in Major League Baseball. Teams win games by scoring more runs than their adversary. In principle, better players are costlier, so teams that want good players need to spend more money. Teams that spend the most, frequently win the most. So, the question is, __How can a team that can’t spend so much win?__
